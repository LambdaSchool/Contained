1. Controller containment refers to embedding one view controller inside of another view controller. It helps developers to better organize their code.

2. Navigation allows you to follow one or more branches down a linear path. Once you reach the end of the path you are either done or you are able to use a segue to connect with a previous screen. Tab controllers allow you to select buttons at the bottom of the view to select a specific view you would like to see. It is non-linear. Navigation could be used if you are creating a linear app, such as a choose-your-own adventure story, that does not require the user to visit certain pages multiple times. The tab controller would work well in an app that contains a shopping cart, or a game where your character has an inventory and stats. In both cases the user may wish to visit the same place multiple times no matter which view the user is looking at at the time.

3. Viber uses Navigation. You  Fitbit uses both Navigation and Tab Controller.  I think now that the use of one or the other may depend on preference. You can accomplish the same thing using both if you use enough segues. I cannot give an in-depth description as to how the Navigation and Tab Controller affects the use of the above apps because I had to do some research online - I owned an iPod Touch for a few months when I was 17, but that is the extent of my owning any kind of mobile Apple product.
