What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?
Controller containment allows developers to use many storyboards and views neatly and separately. They can keep the code for each storyboard in its own file and connect them together to work as one functioning app.

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?
Navigation controllers provide movement and navigation between the view controllers. Tab controllers create tabs at the bottom and create a direct connection to the view it's attached to. It simply depends on what type of app you're trying to build.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app. 

The photos stock app uses containers to move through the albums.
