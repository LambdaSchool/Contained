What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?
Controller containment occurs when one view controller is placed, or embedded, inside of another view controller. 

Developers benefit from view containment because they are able to display varied viewer content within a single view controller.  Developers are able to create custom views by embedding and populate the various views.

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?
The navigation controller navigates through linked view controllers. As a user navigates through a navigation controller each linked page is stacked on top of the proceeding page.  As the user navigates back the pages are removed until the first page is once again displayed.

Tab bar controllers display individual views.  When a new page is navigated via a tab bar controller it replaces the view that is currently being displayed and displays the next view that has been requested.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.
One popular Apple-supplied iOS application that implements containment to create a custom view is the Pages application.  Pages utilizes a navigation controller to allow the user to navigate to the different locations where documents may be stored.

The tab navigation controller located at the bottom of the view contains a tab view controller with two tabs.  One tab is labeled “Recent” which allows the user to navigate to their recently opened documents.  The second tab, labeled “Browse”, sends the user to a filter screen that provides the user with several document attributes that can be used to narrow the number of documents that may be displayed to the user.
