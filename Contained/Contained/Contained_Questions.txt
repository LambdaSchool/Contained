	•	What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

Controller containment is when one view controller places another view controller inside of it. For developers, this offers the ability to prevent our view controller from becoming hundreds of code lines long by breaking it up into separate view controllers.

	•	What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?

The difference between navigation and tab controllers is that, navigation controllers manage a stack of view controllers to provide an interface for hierarchical content, while tab controllers organize an app into one or more distinct modes of operation.

	•	Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.

I was not able to attend or view the lecture today, but I believe one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class is the Photo app. Tab bar is used to view all photos, albums, search, and tailored for the user photos. Navigation bar is used when you click on an album, photos, or a tab bar option and allows you to navigate back and forth, or select photos. Photos, also includes collection views and table views.
