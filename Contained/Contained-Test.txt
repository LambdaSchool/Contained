Q:	What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

A:	Controller containment is the mechanism by which developers can embed views in navigation or tab bar controllers. This gives developers the ready made tools in order to navigate between views in storyboards.

Q:	What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?

A:	A navigation controller is aligned along the top of a view and allows you to add buttons and titles. You can use those buttons to segue to another view at which point a back button will allow you to return to the previous view. In contrast, tab controllers are aligned along the bottom of a view and allow you to add different tabs with or without icons. These tabs do not change no matter the view, other than to specify which tab is associated with the current view.

Q:	Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.

A:	The, Apple-supplied, "Clock" app uses a tab bar controller in order to allow for navigation between views such as "World Clock", "Alarm", and "Timer." Each of these tabs takes you to a corresponding view with different functions. The "Settings" app is an example of an app that uses a navigation controller to allow users to select a setting such as "Notifications" and go back to "Settings," by simply tapping the back button in the top left corner of the view.
