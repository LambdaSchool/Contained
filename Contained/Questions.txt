What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

Controller containment is when a controller is placed within another controller.  Such as a view controller in a navigation controller.  Helps developers organize their code and can link multiple view controllers to another controller.

Difference between navigation and tab controllers.  Under what circumstances do you use each?

Navigation controllers organize view controllers like a stack of papers and tab bar controllers organize different screens that could have different functionality.
If you had different view controllers that did different things like one that displays information, and one for settings, you could separate those with a tab bar controller.
If you were going from one screen to the next in a series you could use a navigation controller and stack the screens on top of each other in order.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.



An example of a navigation controller is the Settings app.  The screens will stack on top of one another as you move from one screen to the next.

An example of a tab bar controller is the clock app.  It allows you to switch to different screens with different functionality that switch between screens.
