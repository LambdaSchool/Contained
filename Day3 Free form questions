What is controller containment?
Controller containment is a practice of using special controllers to contain user interface elements that are used for navigation and selection between views.

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?
Tab Controller can be used "horizontally" to move broadly across different functions of an app. Navigation Controller can be used for navigation deeper into layers of views related to a given function (ie "vertically")

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class how they're used in each app.
- Apple's Notes app uses a Navigation Controller to allow user to select each note and then allow them to go back to the notes list
- Apple's Phone app uses a Tab Controller to list the options available to users - for example favorites, recents, contacts.
