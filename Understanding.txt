What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

	Controller containment allows a developer to embed a view controller inside of another one.  It offers a way to organize multiple view controllers.

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?

	The navigation controller allows different views to be either pushed to the screen or popped from the screen.  Navigation buttons sit on the top of the screen to allow you to navigate to the different view controllers that are on the stack. You would use navigation to view something related to that stack.  Tab controllers are another way to move between different view controllers, but instead of pushing and popping you are just selecting through whichever views are on the bottom of the screen.  Usually not related to that stack.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.

	The settings app uses a navigation controller to organize different settings.  When you click on something in the settings a view is pushed to the screen to show more details and settings within the button pressed.  The phone app uses a tab bar controller to display different views.  Each tab is independent of the others, one can display a list of contacts, another could be the dial pad.
