•	What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

	Controller Containment allows developers to embed one view controller within another.

•	What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?

	Navigation controllers can manage one or more views at the same time, but only one child view controller is visible at a time. Tab controllers select between different views and their associated modes. A navigation controller would be used to navigate hierarchal data whereas the tab controllers would be used to switch between different views where different hierarchies can be available at any given time.

•	Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.

	The settings app utilizes the Navigation controller to move through individual elements of the sections in a hierarchal order. When one element is selected, the user is taken to another table view and can select elements and/or edit elements associated with that particular element. The clock app utilizes the tab controller to switch between different modes for the app. The user can edit the settings within each tab and select a tab to move to a new view and the updated elements from the previous view will remain.
