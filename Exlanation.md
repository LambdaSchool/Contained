1. When one view controller places another view controller inside of it. Also can be embedding a view controller into another view controller
2. Like Navigation controllers, Tab bar controllers are excellent navigation objects. Unlike navigation controllers, instead of having a "previous" and "next" button at the top of the screen, it has all of the possible views to navigate to listed at the bottom on a bar, each view with it's associated tab. If I needed a page to fill someone's information out, or display information for the user, I would use the Navigation controller. However, if I had views that were relatively unrelated and all served different purposes, I would use a tab bar controller.
3. The Clock app in iOS uses a tab bar controller for "World Clock" "Alarm" "Bedtime" "Stopwatch" "Timer" but then has "Edit" and "+" at the top in a navigation bar to create, edit or delete, new alarms, new world clocks, etc.
