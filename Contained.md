# Contained

**What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?**

View controller containment is when one controller places another controller inside of it. It offers a more organized structure to view controllers and prevents them from becoming and massive unmanageable.

**What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?**

Navigation controllers allow you to stack view that can be accessed with bar buttons. Tab controllers allow you to access different types of views without having to go through one or the other to access them. They are good for when you want to access different perspectives of the same or relatable data.

**Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.**

Photos - the tab bar at the bottom allows you to access albums, photos, search. The navigation allows you to access different areas in those tabbed out sections, and photos are contained in those views.
