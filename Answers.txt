What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?
It allows one view controller to be embed in another and run the code from the parent and have different code on the child.


What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?
Tab controllers have 2 or more buttons at the bottom of the view that take you to different vc's.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.
Clock - has tab bar controller at the bottom
views are embed in nav controllers giving back buttons
