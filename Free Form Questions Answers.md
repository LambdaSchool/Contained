# Demonstrate your understanding of today's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Submit them as a text file along with your project.

**What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?**

View controller containment allows you to embed one view controller inside another, which can simplify and organize your code.

**What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?**

Navigation controllers manage a stack of view controllers based on a hierarchy while tab controllers coordinate the navigation between the view hierarchies.

**Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.**

The iOS Clock App uses tab controllers to essentially provide 4 apps inside 1 app. The Apple Settings App uses navigation controllers that allow you to push further into the settings in one direction and then allows you to exit the same way you came.
