## View Controller Containment and UITabBarController

**What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?**  
Start the answer.  I won't need a new line until I start the next question.

**What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?**  
The next question

**Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.**  
One popular Apple-supplied iOS application that implements containment to create a custom view is the Pages application.  Pages utilizes a navigation controller to allow the user to navigate to the different locations where documents may be stored.

The tab navigation controller located at the bottom of the view contains a tab view controller with two tabs.  One tab is labeled “Recent” which allows the user to navigate to their recently opened documents.  The second tab, labeled “Browse”, sends the user to a filter screen that provides the user with several document attributes that can be used to narrow the number of documents that may be displayed to the user.
