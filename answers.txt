What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?
	Controller containment allows one to the reuse a view controller on multiple view controllers.

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?
	Tab controllers allow for switching between completely separate sets of data/functionality which stay in memory once loaded, where as Navigation controllers push and pop views on the screen during processes, and once a view is popped off it is unloaded from memory. 	


Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.
	The Clock app is a good example of a tabbed interface whereas the Settings app is Navigation controller.  The Health app has both in use.
